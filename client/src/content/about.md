# About Mediator

I consume a lot of media. Recently, I realized that all of those experiences will fade into memory. Mediator was created from a growing sense that I need to keep track of the stories and sounds that fill my time.

Letterboxd and similar services are perfectly fine for most people, but I find that they come with far more functionality than I want, and lack the simplicity and usability that I like.

I'm also committed to upping my React knowledge, honing my UI/UX design skills and feeling out this hole "Vibe Coding" thing. What I've made here comes with the assistance of AI, but not entirely; much of the codebase is handwritten. I can't imagine how I'd be able to accomplish the pixel perfection that I demand from the stuff I build without my development background.

## Data Sources

I found some free media APIs to deliver search results:

- [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) - Movie data
- [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) - Book data
- [MusicBrainz API](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API) - Album data

P.S. No personal data is collected or distributed in any way. I'm committed to ensuring the privacy of any users and detest sketchy services. Mediator is safe, private and non-monetizing.
